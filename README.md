# GENEO TEST

## Tasks
  
  - Endpoint to register users, based on email and password. Email validation is mandatory. Password requirements should be implemented.
  - Endpoint to authenticate users, which should return a JWT token and a refresh token. (Bonus points if JWT token is set as a HTTP cookie and returned in the response object).
  - Users should have two available roles (ROLE_USER and ROLE_ADMIN).
  - A user should be able to create a post which should contain at least a title and content. A user can have many posts, a post can only be owned by one user.
  - Posts can have the ability to contain images.
  - A user can follow many other users, and be able to see those usersâ€™ most recent posts.
  - A user with ROLE_ADMIN should be able to see a list of pending posts and have endpoints to approve them. Each post should be publishable. That is, an admin needs to approve a post before it is visible to all other users. Until it is published, the owner should be able to modify the post.
  - Each published post should support comments, where each user who follows the owner of the post can comment.
  - Each post should support tags. Multiple tags can be added against a single post.
  - If a user is removed by an admin, their posts should remain visible.
  - If a post is removed (either by the owner or by an admin), comments and media objects should be removed as well.
